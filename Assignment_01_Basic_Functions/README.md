I recently installed R and RStudio on my Windows computer. Since I already had both programs downloaded prior to this task, the installation process was straightforward and did not present any major issues. I simply ran the R installer first, followed by the RStudio Desktop installer, and both programs were set up without any errors or conflicts.

During the installation, I checked to ensure that R was properly linked to RStudio. Initially, RStudio prompted me to select the R version to use, but this was quickly resolved by choosing the default R installation path provided by the installer. Other than that minor setup step, no further troubleshooting was required.


For reference, my system details are as follows: I am using Windows 11, with R version 4.3.2 and RStudio version 2025.06.0+421. The RStudio console opened successfully, and I was able to run basic commands without any issues. Overall, the installation process was smooth, and both programs are ready for use in data analysis and statistical computing tasks.



In R, a vector is basically a way to store a bunch of things of the same type like numbers, words, or TRUE/FALSE values all in one place. You can create vectors using functions like c(), and you can do things like access specific elements, slice parts of the vector, or even perform math on all the numbers at once. Vectors are really important in R because almost everything else like matrices, lists, and data framesi s built on them. Understanding vectors makes it much easier to work with data, do calculations, and analyze information efficiently.
